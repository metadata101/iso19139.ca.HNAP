LeBrasseur and N. Brent Hargreaves led a juvenile salmon migration research project off the west coast of Vancouver Island BC.  This included the development of surface beam trawl gear that could be deployed from a large trawl vessel (CCGS W.E. Ricker) and operated in an offshore environment.  This dataset contains the research survey catch data and individual fish examinations data."
